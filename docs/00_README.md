    # Mini ERP MVP Documentation Pack

    - Version: MVP v0.1
    - Status: Index
    - Date: 2026-03-09

    This archive contains the baseline documentation set for the first working version of a small-business Mini ERP.

## Product intent

The product is a **small, working ERP core** for a small business. It is intentionally limited to:

- master data: Items, Suppliers, Customers, Warehouses
- purchase flow: Purchase Orders and Receipts
- sales flow: Sales Orders and Shipments
- inventory visibility: Stock Balances and Stock Movements
- dashboard, navigation shell, list/detail pages, and a strict enterprise UI baseline

The system is **not** trying to be a full ERP or WMS in v0.1.

- One operational warehouse in MVP logic, but Warehouse remains a full entity
- No reservation logic
